# NetprojectWebsite
Final project for a Networking course. 

## Concept 
In this project, I had to use Microsoft Azure to host 3 Linux Virtual Machines, all of them hosting this simple login page. A load balancer was used under the three VM, and after a succesful login, authenticated using LDAP, the WebPage redirects to an Azure Image Recognition service. Every VM has a SSL Certificate provided by the teacher (authority), and the webpage succesfuly displays HTTPS.

## Learned Skills
- Linux VMs - Network management
- Azure VM and Load Balancer Deployment
- SSL
- LDAP and Active Directory
